# PacificVis-2019

In 2014, an outburst of this “deadliest disease in Africa” happened in West Africa.
The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is a rare viral disease that transmits to humans through contact or bodily fluids. It was originally observed in the then Zaire, now, the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. The virus is believed to spread through bats and bush meat. Since August of 2018, there is a new EVD outbreak in Congo. The continuous and wild spread has drawn worldwide attention from medical professionals to governments at different levels. We attempt to understand the developing trend of this virus since it was first identified.
